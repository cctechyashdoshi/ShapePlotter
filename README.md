# :octocat: Create your own 2D Geometry using `ShapePlotter`

The Shape Plotter is a C++ program that enables users to input the coordinates of a shape's vertices. It saves these coordinates to a .dat file, which can be visualized using Gnuplot. The project aims to help users plot custom shapes and visualize them by generating .dat files for easy plotting.
